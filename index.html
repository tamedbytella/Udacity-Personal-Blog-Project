        <p class="first-line-bold">For as long as I could remember doing hair was something I've always enjoyed. 
            But I never wanted to do it for a living. I remember scoffing at the idea of
            standing up all day styling someone's hair. Look at me now... They say if you tell God your plans
            he'll laugh at you, but this wasn't my plan. I dont think I had one anyway. What I did have was ideas, wants and needs.
            I had to be about 7 when I told my Father I wanted to build computers and make more money than Bill Gates. 
            Fast forward to Freshman year of High School, I started tutoring at my former JHS. Which is where the idea to become a teacher developed.
            Dreams of computers and giant wads of cash were behind me by then. We can skip to the part where I had my first kid. Mom wasn't happy 
            but she took it like a champ and jumped in to help me. At some point i thought i had life figured out but when your 15 with a baby you dont know shit! 
            Life will definitely humble you because 3 years later I was again with child. Like really Sis you didnt learn? Life was hard enough but adding another kid to the roster
            wasn't going to make it easier. 
            
            <blockquote>Oh! The places you'll go! You'll be on your way up! You'll be seeing great sights! You'll join the high fliers who soar to high heights". -Dr. Seuss</blockquote>
        </p>
       
        <p> So of course life kept doing that thing we like to call "lifing". It's not a real word but i'm sure you get it. But back to those ideas, wants and needs. I wanted a good a life, 
            travel the world and to live freely.
            However, that is pretty damn expensive and my childrens needs took precedence. My stint as Medicaid Coordinator in a skilled nursing facility sparked my interest in Social Work. 
            I wanted to advocate for the elderly, be their voice and fight for them. Turns out I needed to get a degree.  Writing college papers all night, fulltime work and being a hands on Mom 
             was not an option for me. I needed money to survive and reducing my hours to squeeze in school time wasnt going to cut it!

        </p>
       
        <p> A few years later I'm married added another child to the growing brood and relocated to New Jersey. During a converstation with a newly acquired friend I toyed with the idea of going to hair school. 
            It seemed easy enough and I was already good at it. How hard could it be? I did a little research and submitted an inquiry to a few schools. The closest school to my house was an hour bus ride and 
            immediately the thought of hardships were enough of a deterrant. My phone rang and emails were piling up from these hungry admissions counselors. I was so annoyed. But after 3 months of bullshitting 
            I scheduled a tour and enrolled. It felt right and thus my career started... 
        
        </p>

        <p> 
           Ten years into the industry and my desires of continuning on this path has changed. Dont get me wrong its rewarding,  I love my clients and I love the transformations. But my heart is telling me its time
            to try something else. Although, I dont think I will leave this industry for good. I'm more than certain when I purchase my first home I'll build an in home salon suite. But as of now, 
            there is something about computers and software that I love. Reconnecting with my childhood has ignited a deeply hidden passion that never had the chance to develop. 
            Thanks to Udacity and this One Ten scholarship for making this possible. Shoutout to the algorithm for pushing it to my facebook page. Otherwise, I wouldnt have taken the chance...
